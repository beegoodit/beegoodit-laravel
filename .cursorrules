# GOLDEN RULE: Show, Don't Tell

When you finish implementing:
1. Run the code
2. Show me the terminal output
3. That's the only proof of "working code"

No output = No working code = Not done

# Listen Before Acting

Understand the requirement before writing code.

# Read the Codebase First

Verify what exists before using it.

# Use Existing Patterns

Before implementing any feature or component:
1. Search the codebase for existing implementations that solve the same or similar problem
2. Use the patterns already established in the codebase
3. The codebase patterns take precedence over framework defaults or documentation
4. Only create new patterns if no suitable example exists

# Read the Official Documentation

Consult official docs for the tools you're using.

# Separation of Concerns

Don't mix different responsibilities.

# Documentation: Less is More

Focus on essentials, not everything.

# Code Must Work

Test before delivery.
